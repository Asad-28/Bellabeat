## **Prepare**

#### **Overview of the Data**

**Information on the Data Source**

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle’s *FitBit Fitness Tracker Data*, includes 18 CSV files generated by 33 respondents via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 and 12 May 2016. It contains data on physical activity, heart rate, sleep, daily activities, and steps.

**Limitations of the Dataset**

-   Data is from 2016, potentially outdated as users’ habits and behaviors may have changed.

-   Lacks key user attributes such as age, gender, location, and lifestyle.

-   The sample size of 33 is not representative of the general fitness population.

-   Data integrity and accuracy cannot be verified due to survey collection.

**Is the Data ROCCC?**

-   **Reliable**: Low – Limited respondents and some data points are incomplete.

-   **Original**: Low – Collected via third-party (Amazon Mechanical Turk).

-   **Comprehensive**: Medium – Parameters align with most Bellabeat product features.

-   **Current**: Low – Data from 2016 may not be relevant today.

-   **Cited**: Low – Collected from a third-party source, lacking traceability.

**Conclusion**: The dataset’s reliability and credibility are insufficient for in-depth analysis. Insights should be treated as high-level guidance and verified with more robust, current data sources.

#### **Work Environment** Setup

First, all relevant packages are installed and then loaded. Ensure the required functionalities are available for data import, manipulation, and visualization. The rio package is used for importing data, dplyr for data manipulation and transformation, and ggplot2 for creating visualizations.”

```{r}
library(rio)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## **Process**

#### **Importing Data**

To begin the analysis, the relevant datasets are imported into the R environment. Given the small sample size of the data available, the focus is placed on the ‘daily’ dataset, as it is more likely to yield high-level insights. The import() function from the `rio` package is used to load the following datasets:

-   activity: Contains daily activity data.

-   steps: Contains hourly step count data.

-   weight: Contains weight log information.

-   sleep: Contains daily sleep data.

```{r}
activity <- import("/Users/Asad/Developer/Bellabeat/data/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
steps <- import("/Users/Asad/Developer/Bellabeat/data/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
weight <- import("/Users/Asad/Developer/Bellabeat/data/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
sleep <- import("/Users/Asad/Developer/Bellabeat/data/sleepDay_merged.csv")
```

#### **Reading the Data**

Review the data to look for useful starting points and patterns.

```{r}
glimpse(activity)
```

```{r}
glimpse(steps)
```

```{r}
glimpse(weight)
```

```{r}
glimpse(sleep)
```

#### Check for Distinct

To understand the number of unique users represented in each dataset, the `n_distinct()` function from the `dplyr` package was used. This function counts the number of distinct values in the specified column, helping to determine the number of unique user IDs.

```{r}
n_distinct(activity$Id)
```

```{r}
n_distinct(steps$Id)
```

```{r}
n_distinct(weight$Id)
```

```{r}
n_distinct(sleep$Id)
```

#### **Fixing Formatting**

To ensure proper analysis, the formatting of timestamp data was corrected. The as.Date() and as.POSIXct() functions were used to convert date and time columns in the datasets into appropriate datetime formats. This step is crucial for accurate data manipulation and analysis.

```{r}
activity$ActivityDate <- as.Date(activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
steps$ActivityHour <- as.POSIXct(steps$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
weight$Date <- as.POSIXct(weight$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
sleep$SleepDay <- as.POSIXct(sleep$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p")
```

These changes ensure the datetime columns are properly recognized, facilitating accurate time-based analysis in subsequent steps.”

#### Check for (and remove) duplicates

This section checks for duplicate rows in the datasets and removes them if necessary.

```{r}
sum(duplicated(activity))
```

```{r}
sum(duplicated(steps))
```

```{r}
sum(duplicated(weight))
```

```{r}
sum(duplicated(sleep))
```

```{r}
sleep <- sleep %>% distinct()
sum(duplicated(sleep))
```

The `duplicated()` function was used to count the number of duplicate rows in the activity, steps, weight, and sleep datasets. The `distinct()` function was then applied to the sleep dataset to remove these duplicates. The final check confirms that no duplicates remain in sleep, with the result being 0.

#### Check for rows with NA or missing info

In this process of identifying and handling rows in a dataset that contain missing or undefined values, often represented as `NA` in R. This step is essential in data analysis to ensure the data is clean and reliable, as missing values can affect statistical calculations, visualizations, and overall insights derived from the data.

```{r}
sum(is.na(activity))
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(steps))
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(weight))
```

```{r}
weight <- drop_na(weight)
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(weight))
```

```{r}
sum(is.na(sleep))
```

After identifying the missing values, the drop_na() function was applied to the weight dataset to remove rows with NA, leaving it clean and free of missing data. The other datasets remain unchanged. This ensures the cleaned weight dataset is ready for analysis, while the presence of missing values in the other datasets may require further handling.

## **Analyze**

This a process of examining and summarizing the key variables within the datasets to extract important insights and patterns. This step involves using functions like summary() to provide descriptive statistics, which include measures such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. By analyzing these variables, we gain a better understanding of user behaviors and trends in activity, sleep, weight, and other relevant metrics. This step is essential for identifying general patterns, variability, and potential areas for further investigation in the data.

#### Sleep

```{r}
sleep %>%  
  select(SleepDay,
         TotalSleepRecords,
         TotalMinutesAsleep) %>%
  summary()
```

The summary statistics for the SleepDay variable ranges from April 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016, with a mean date of April 26, 2016. The TotalSleepRecords variable shows that most users have one sleep record per day, with a maximum of three records. The TotalMinutesAsleep variable has a minimum value of 58 minutes and a maximum of 796 minutes, with a mean of approximately 419.5 minutes, indicating variability in sleep duration across users. The median sleep duration is 433 minutes, suggesting that half of the sleep records fall below and half above this value.

#### Weight

```{r}
weight %>%  
  select(WeightKg,
         Fat,
         BMI) %>%
  summary()
```

The summary statistics for the weight data indicate that the WeightKg variable ranges from a minimum of 52.60 kg to a maximum of 72.40 kg, with a mean and median of 62.50 kg, suggesting a fairly balanced distribution. The Fat variable has a minimum value of 22.00% and a maximum of 25.00%, with a mean and median of 23.50%, indicating a moderate range of body fat percentages. The BMI variable, which ranges from 22.65 to 27.45, has a mean and median of 25.05, suggesting that most users fall within the lower to middle range of the BMI scale. The interquartile range for WeightKg, Fat, and BMI shows that 50% of the data points fall between 57.55-67.45 kg for weight, 22.75%-24.25% for body fat, and 23.85-26.25 for BMI, highlighting typical values within the dataset.

#### Steps

```{r}
steps %>%  
  select(StepTotal,
         ActivityHour,
         ) %>%
  summary()
```

The summary statistics for the steps data reveal important trends regarding user activity. The StepTotal variable ranges from 0 to 10,554 steps, with a mean of 320.2 steps and a median of 40 steps, suggesting that while the average step count is relatively low, there are instances of much higher activity. The ActivityHour variable indicates the timestamps of recorded activities, with the minimum timestamp starting on April 12, 2016, and the maximum on May 12, 2016. The mean activity hour is approximately 11:46 AM, and the median activity hour is 6:00 AM, suggesting that most activity data is recorded in the early and mid-day periods, with variations in the timing of user activity throughout the analysis period.

#### Activity

```{r}
activity %>%  
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         Calories,
         SedentaryMinutes) %>%
  summary()
```

The summary statistics for the activity data provide insights into user behavior and physical activity levels. The TotalSteps variable ranges from 0 to 36,019 steps, with a mean of 7,638 steps and a median of 7,406 steps, indicating that the majority of users take a moderate number of steps daily. The TotalDistance variable, with a range from 0 to 28.03 km and a mean of 5.49 km, shows that users cover a variable distance, with the median at 5.245 km. The Calories variable ranges from 0 to 4,900 calories, with a mean of 2,304 and a median of 2,134, suggesting that calorie expenditure varies significantly across users. The SedentaryMinutes variable ranges from 0 to 1,440 minutes (24 hours), with a mean of 991.2 minutes and a median of 1,057.5 minutes, indicating that users spend a substantial portion of their day in a sedentary state, with some variation in activity levels.

#### Steps vs Calories

```{r}
custom_colors_scatter <- c(
  rgb(251/255, 127/255, 120/255),  # Color for points
  rgb(252/255, 148/255, 164/255)   # Color for the smooth line
)

ggplot(data = activity) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories), color = custom_colors_scatter[1]) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = TotalSteps, y = Calories), color = custom_colors_scatter[2]) +
  labs(title = "Steps vs Calories",
       x = "Total Steps",
       y = "Calories Burned (kcal)",
       caption = "Data from 12/04/2016 to 12/05/2016")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

This scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the total number of steps taken and the calories burned (in kcal). The x-axis represents the total steps, ranging from 0 to 35,000, while the y-axis represents the calories burned, ranging from 0 to 5,000 kcal. Each red dot represents a data point for a specific instance of steps taken and corresponding calories burned.

A trend line is drawn through the data points, indicating a positive correlation between the number of steps taken and the calories burned. The shaded area around the trend line represents the confidence interval, showing the range within which the true trend is likely to fall.

The data is collected from 12/04/2016 to 12/05/2016, as indicated in the bottom right corner of the image. This chart visually demonstrates how physical activity (measured in steps) is associated with energy expenditure (measured in calories burned), which can be useful for understanding the impact of walking or other step-based activities on calorie burning.

#### Calories vs Sedentary Time

```{r}
ggplot(data = activity) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = SedentaryMinutes, y = Calories), color = custom_colors_scatter[1]) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = SedentaryMinutes, y = Calories), color = custom_colors_scatter[2]) +
  labs(title = "Calories vs Sedentary Time",
       x = "Sedentary Time (Min)",
       y = "Calories Burned (kcal)",
       caption = "Data from 12/04/2016 to 12/05/2016") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The plot demonstrates a general trend where an increase in sedentary time corresponds to an increase in calories burned, though the relationship appears non-linear. This suggests that while sedentary behavior is associated with energy expenditure, the rate may change at different levels of sedentary time. The trend line’s curve indicates that after a certain point, further increases in sedentary time do not significantly impact the calories burned.

#### Sleep Time vs Time in Bed

```{r}
ggplot(data = sleep, mapping = aes(x = TotalMinutesAsleep, y = TotalTimeInBed)) +
  geom_point(color = custom_colors_sleep[1]) +
  geom_smooth(color = custom_colors_sleep[2]) +
  labs(title = "Sleep Time vs Time in Bed",
       x = "Total Time Asleep (hours)",
       y = "Total Time in Bed (hours)",
       caption = "Data from 12/04/2016 to 12/05/2016") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The plot illustrates that as the total time asleep increases, the total time spent in bed also tends to increase, indicating a direct relationship between these two variables. However, there are some data points where individuals spent significantly more time in bed than sleeping, suggesting variations in sleep efficiency.

## **Act**

#### **Insights and Recommendations for Shareholders**

-   **Activity and Calorie Burn:** There is a direct relationship between steps taken and calories burned. Encouraging walking through incentives like a points system or reminders can promote more activity. Most activities logged are low-intensity; promoting high-intensity workouts through guided sessions or challenges could increase calorie burn.

-   **Sleep Patterns:** Users sleep slightly less than the recommended 7 hours on average. Bedtime reminders and notifications can encourage better sleep habits.

-   **App Usage Trends:** Engagement starts strong on Tuesdays but declines through the week, reaching its lowest on Mondays. Motivational reminders at the end of the week and on Mondays could sustain usage.

#### **Recommendations for Future Analysis**

-   Expanding the sample size and analyzing data over 6-12 months would improve the reliability of findings and account for seasonal behavior changes.

-   Including additional metrics like age and hydration could provide deeper insights into user behavior.

-   Combining internal data with external sources would enhance credibility and the robustness of analyses.

#### **Guiding Questions**

-   **Trends in Smart Device Usage:** Users burn more calories with increased steps and higher-intensity activities, but most activity logged is low-intensity. Sleep averages are below 7 hours, and app engagement decreases throughout the week, bottoming out on Mondays.

-   **Application to Bellabeat Customers:** Encouraging activity and better sleep habits through notifications, challenges, and reminders can improve customer wellness. Addressing dips in engagement can maintain consistent app usage.

-   **Influence on Marketing Strategy:** Trends can shape targeted campaigns focusing on step tracking, sleep improvement, and engagement challenges. Personalized offers like guided workouts and loyalty points could enhance customer satisfaction and retention.
